# Computer Vision Assignments
#### Assignment Details
### Part 1: supervised contrastive learning  - Using new loss 
Write a colab to demonstrate supervised contrastive learning loss based supervised classification versus regular softmax based one
### Part 2: Transfer learning on various modalities : 
Transfer learning on various modalities : Write simple colabs to transfer learn on images, videos, audios -  - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecases. Showcase basic transfer learning for a classification task (either cats/dogs or breeds of dogs) in a colab - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecase
### Part 3: Zero shot transfer learning in colab
Showcase zero shot transfer learning with CLIP model. Showcase transfer learning using state of art models from tfhub (Eg: use bigtransfer for example) using tfhub
